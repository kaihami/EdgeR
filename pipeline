1) 3-step method:

estimateGLMCommonDisp
estimateGLMTrendedDisp
estimateGLMTagwiseDisp
2) All-in-one method:

estimateDisp
3) Robust method

estimateGLMRobustDisp
4) QL

estimateDisp
glmQLFit
 

The estimateDisp function help file says it's similar to calling estimateGLMCommonDisp > estimateGLMTrendedDisp > estimateGLMTagwiseDisp, but also that it gives slightly different results. What's the difference between these two approaches, and is estimateDisp always the preferred?

The estimateDisp also has an argument called robust, which is suggested to be set to TRUE in the edgeR user guide. Is running estimateDisp(robust=TRUE) similar to running estimateGLMRobustDisp? 

To make the confusion total, there's the separate approach of using the QL approach instead. The manual suggests using estimateDisp(robust=TRUE), even glmQLFit re-estimates the dispersions. Again, glmQLFit also has an argument called robust. In addition, it has an argument called abundance.trend (which I have not seen mentioned in any manuals), should this ever be set to TRUE?

What's considered a good rule of thumb for running the different implementations? Something like below:

edgeR:

estimateDisp(robust=TRUE)
glmFit
glmLRT
edgeR robust:

estimateGLMRobustDisp
glmFit
glmLRT
edgeR QL:

estimateDisp(robust=TRUE)
glmQLFit(robust=TRUE)
glmQLFTest
